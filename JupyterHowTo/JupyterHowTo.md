    After you click submit the page may not immediately respond. *Do not click submit multiple times* as this may result in multiple unneccesary jobs being submitted which can create problems for you and others.

5) You should now be at a screen with a bunch of links that looks like this:

    Each link is one Jupyter job. *The bottom link is the most recently launched job*. The links above could be your other notebooks that are still running, or old jobs from hours ago that have exited.

6) Click the *bottom most* link.

    If your job is not yet running, you will see a loading screen that looks like this:
