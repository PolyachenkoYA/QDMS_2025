  2-graphene_oxide_water/

Step 2: In exercise/, Force-field parameters are defined, and MB-pol related instructions has been removed. Observe difference between exercise/ and solution/ for

 1-graphene_water/
 2-graphene_oxide_water/

and attempt to modify

 2-graphene_oxide_water/
 4-cnt_water/

then check solutions. To submit job, run in each folder

 sbatch ../../script/run.job
