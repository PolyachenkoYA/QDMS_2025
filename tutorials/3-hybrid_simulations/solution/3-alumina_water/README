1. Bonded interactions:

within alumina: 
---------------
ClayFF takes care of it through harmonic potential
only bonded interaction is for OH bonds

within water: 
-------------
MBX takes care of it

##########################
2. Coulombic interactions:

within alumina: 
---------------
No coulombic interactions are specified using lammps
All coulombic interactions are calculated by MBX. 
Since ClayFF does not need coulombic interactions for bonded atoms, we use coul exclude on alumina OH to remove the coulombic interactions calculated using MBX

within water: 
-------------
MBX takes care of it
MB-pol charges are used. So, any charges in the input files for water won't be used.

between water and alumina: 
--------------------------
MBX takes care of it

###################################
3. LJ (Van der waals) interactions:

within alumina (only non-bonded atoms): 
---------------
clayff takes care of it. (including the mixing part through pair modify arithmetic)
By default Lammps only calculates LJ for non-bonded interactions.

within water:
-------------
MBX takes care of it.

between water and alumina:
--------------------------
mixing rules take care of it
